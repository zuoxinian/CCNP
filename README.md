# CCNP - Chinese Color-Nest Project
This is a twenty-year project, and its long-term goal is to create neurobiologically sound developmental curves for the brain to characterize phenomenological changes associated with the onset of varying forms of mental health and learning disorders, as well as to predict the developmental status (i.e., age-expected values) of an individual brainâ€™s structure or function. Beyond neurodevelopment, lifespan perspectives can help reveal commonalities and differences among pathophysiologic processes that manifest similar symptom profiles at different stages in life. From a neurological perspective, brain maturation and aging curves may prove useful for identifying factors that can mitigate neurocognitive decline and potentially identify optimal periods for intervention. With this tool, we are seeking knowledge that will translate into a better life style and diagnosis/treatment for patients.

# CCNP - Pilot
CCNP takes its pilot stage (2013 - 2022) of the first ten-year. This is funded by the National Key Basic Research and Development (973) Program (2015CB351702), the Major Joint Fund for International Cooperation and Exchange of the Natural Science Foundation of China (81220108014), the Key Research Program (KSZD-EW-TZ-002) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National R&D Infrastructure and Facility Development Program of China, Fundamental Science Data Sharing Platform (DKA2019-12-02-21), the China - Netherlands CAS-NWO Programme (153111KYSB20160020) and the Brain Cognition and Medicine Program of the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (Z161100002616023). It aims at establishing protocols on the Chinese normative brain development trajectories across the human lifespan.

The CCNP pilot comprises three connected components: stdCCNP, devCCNP and ageCCNP.

1) The stdCCNP recruits total 240 adults (20-60 years) as participants, and each participant visits three ultra-high field (two 3T and one 7T) MRI scanners located at the CAS Institute of Psychology (GE) and the CAS Institute of Biophysics (Simens), generating 5 scans including two-week test-retest data at the two 3T scanners (see the illustration of its design in below). This component (2016 - 2017) serves resources for standardizing pipelines of data collection, storage and analyses based upon the test-retest reliability and reproducibility across scanners, which will be employed for other two components.

2) The devCCNP (2017 - 2022), also called 'Growing Up in China', targets longitudinal data from 480 typically developing kids (see the illustration of its design in below). As a trial sample using the devCCNP design has been tested at Southwest University, which includes 3 waves of neuroimaging data from 192 developing children (6-18 years) across five years (2013 - 2017).

3) The ageCCNP (2017 - 2022) collects a longitudinal dataset from 480 healthy old adults (see the illustration of its design in below). The age span of the ageCCNP is 60-84 years.

# CCNP - Twins Brain Cohort
This is the second ten-year phase of the CCNP (2021 - 2030), which is designed for building the normative curves on brain development dervied from 6000 pairs of twins across the life span (6 - 85 years).
