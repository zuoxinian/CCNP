# CCNP - Chinese Color-Nest Project
This is a twenty-year project, and its long-term goal is to create neurobiologically sound developmental curves for the brain to characterize phenomenological changes associated with the onset of varying forms of mental health and learning disorders, as well as to predict the developmental status (i.e., age-expected values) of an individual brainâ€™s structure or function. Beyond neurodevelopment, lifespan perspectives can help reveal commonalities and differences among pathophysiologic processes that manifest similar symptom profiles at different stages in life. From a neurological perspective, brain maturation and aging curves may prove useful for identifying factors that can mitigate neurocognitive decline and potentially identify optimal periods for intervention. We are seeking knowledge that will translate into a better life style and diagnosis/treatment for patients.
